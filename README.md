# Discord Phishing Demo

⚠Do not misuse this project, it is just made for fun and to demonstrate how these things work⚠


### How it's done

This demonstration is made in react.js, great framework overall. And uses discord webhooks, reasoning is that it's an easy and let's be honest, pretty scalable way, to store write-only information like this. And it is also free + easily disposable.

This is why many IP or token grabbers use discord, even if it's ironically the platform they are supposed to be compromising.

For more information about the inner workings you can read the comments I made in the code, that are pretty in depth and explain things a lot

### Installation

1. Clone into this project or install ZIP of it
2. Run ```npm install```
3. Modify submit.tsx, and replace "PUT WEBHOOK HERE" with your webhook
4. Have fun and don't misuse.


This repo is very good because you can replace the function in $.tsx with any login, and it is easily customizable and really demonstrates the power of phishing. Although you, github user, are probably technologically literate, and would NEVER EVER fall for a phishing link (although this mentality is probably bad to have since that's how people fall for this stuff), think about your classmates, or gaming mates.

This is why we need to improve our security measures and educate end users to make sure that people don't fall for phishing scams.
