# Project Title

⚠Do not misuse this project, it is just made for fun and to demonstrate how these things work⚠


## Explanation

- This demonstration is made in react.js, great framework overall. And uses discord webhooks, reasoning is that it's an easy and let's be honest, pretty scalable way, to store write-only information like this. And it is also free + easily disposable.

- This is why many IP or token grabbers use discord, even if it's ironically the platform they are supposed to be compromising.

- For more information about the inner workings you can read the comments I made in the code, that are pretty in depth and explain things a lot
